This repository is a playground project to showcase classification of 5 different flowers using deep learning. 

Using Streamlit for the user interface and Squeezenet as the deep learning model, this can be used to classify 5 different flowers from the Tensorflow dataset.

FastAPI is used to do the actual prediction which uses transfer learning on a pre-trained squeezenet model. Feature extraction is used.
